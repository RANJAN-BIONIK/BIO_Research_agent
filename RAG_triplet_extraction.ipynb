       "['Interstitial lung disease (ILD) is a significant extra-articular complication of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), characterized by high prevalence and mortality rates. Although advancements have been made in understanding its potential mechanisms, the pathogenesis of RA-associated ILD remains incompletely understood. Recent research has shed light on roles of various disease-related signaling pathways, including TGF-β/SMAD, JAK/STAT, PI3K–Akt, Wnt/β-catenin, and NF-κB, which are implicated in development of both RA and lung fibrosis. These shared pathways, which drive CCL1 PROTEIN production and fibroblast proliferation, offer promising opportunities for therapeutic intervention, including pathway-specific inhibition and drug repurposing. Furthermore, the growing identification of potential biomarkers for early detection and severity assessment in RA-ILD patients holds promise for improving clinical management and guiding treatment strategies. Current treatments fall short in effectively halting the progression of lung fibrosis. This highlights the potential of advancements in signaling pathways and targeted therapies as promising alternatives with significant opportunities for improvement. : rheumatoid arthritis, interstitial lung disease, pathogenesis, signaling pathway, targeted therapy1. Introduction Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic systemic autoimmune disease characterized by symmetric polyarthritis which can cause irreversible joint damage and significant disability . In addition to the common articular involvement, extra-articular manifestations can also occur in RA patients, contributing to overall morbidity and mortality . The lungs, in particular, are frequently affected in individuals with RA experiencing lung-related issues . The disease can affect the lung’s interstitium, airways, and pleurae . Among these, interstitial lung disease (ILD) stands out due to its potential to cause irreversible pulmonary fibrosis, which can significantly worsen the prognosis for those affected, underscoring the importance of comprehensive care in managing RA . The histological features of RA-ILD can be categorized into usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP), nonspecific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP), organizing pneumonia (OP), desquamative interstitial pneumonia (DIP), and lymphocytic interstitial pneumonia (LIP) . Different from most forms of connective-tissue-associated ILD, UIP is more prevalent than NSIP, occurring in up to 61% of RA-ILD patients (7, 8). It shows poor responses to both glucocorticoids and immunosuppression . Therefore, patients with progressive fibrosing phenotypes are restricted to antifibrotic drugs, which often leads to high mortality . Knowledge regarding mechanisms of RA-ILD has been greatly improved in recent years, as accumulated experimental evidence allows more detailed elucidation of potential molecular mechanisms and immunological pathways (4, 11, 12). However, many pathophysiological connections remain unclear. Based on knowledge of current literature, the central need in this area is for early recognition to prevent disease progression and effective therapeutic alternatives to reverse the condition (13, 14). However, this requires clear insights into pathogenesis and a better understanding of shared pathways involved. This review provides an overview of the key mechanisms in the pathogenesis of ILD in RA, as well as the advances in clinical screening and targeted therapies, highlighting areas of shared immunological pathways and ongoing uncertainties in related therapeutic opportunities.2. Pathogenesis The pathogenesis of RA-ILD usually involves the participation of multiple risk factors. Genetic predisposition has been implicated in the development of fibrosis and susceptibility to RA-ILD . Continuous epithelial damage, cellular interactions, and the interplay between the various inflammatory components could lead to the activation of fibroblasts and extracellular matrix deposition, which probably determines the progression of pulmonary fibrosis . During these processes, multiple signaling transduction pathways, including TGF-β/SMAD, JAK/STAT, PI3K–Akt, Wnt/β-catenin, and NF-κB signaling pathways were activated, triggering biological effects of cell proliferation and protein synthesis . 2.1. Genetic predisposition and risk factors Potential risk factors related to the pathogenesis of RA-ILD are summarized in. Both endogenous and exogenous risk factors can contribute to RA-ILD. Previous genetic studies have identified one specific variant of MUC5B DNA that serves as a strong indicator of increased risk of IPF . Specifically, this variant has been suggested to be associated with RA-ILD patients of the UIP pattern . For genes concerned with telomere maintenance, one study of whole-exome sequencing exhibited higher mutation frequency of TERT, PARN PROTEIN and RTEL1 PROTEIN in RA-ILD, which was previously related to familial pulmonary fibrosis . Patients with a TERT, RTEL1 DNA or PARN PROTEIN mutation have shorter telomeres compared with control groups, indicating that premature senescence may play a role in fibrosis and lung remodeling in RA patients . Genetic predisposition of HLA genes to ILD in RA patients has been studied. A lower risk of ILD was found in RA population with shared epitope of HLA-DRB1 DNA in a Japanese cohort . Differently, HLA-DRB1 PROTEIN and HLA-DRB1 PROTEIN from the HLA-DR2 alleles were correlated with a higher risk of ILD . Additionally, another genetic variant at RPA3-UMAD1 was identified in Japanese individuals with RA-ILD .Summary of risk factors related to the pathophysiology of RA-ILD. Both endogenous and exogenous risk factors can contribute to the development of RA-ILD. Individuals with a genetic predisposition, especially older males, are at higher risk of developing RA-ILD. Environmental exposure to pollutants, cigarette smoking, and pro-inflammatory agents are also relevant. Internal dysregulations include epithelial damage, fibroblast activation, inflammation, oxidative stress, ACPA, and RF. RF, rheumatoid factor; ACPA, anti-cyclic citrullinated peptides antibody.Currently, risk factors associated with RA-ILD include genetic variations, older age, male gender, race, and cigarette smoking (23, 24). The abnormal immune response induced by chemical components of cigarettes may underlie the potential mechanism contributing to ILD formation . Meanwhile, autoantibodies, including RF and PRTN3 PROTEIN have been demonstrated to be associated with RA-ILD progression . Continuous exposure to risk factors contributes to epithelial deterioration and activation of immune cells, leading to the excessive accumulation of extracellular matrix in the lung .2.2. Epithelial damage, inflammation, and fibroblast activation Most theories propose the mucosal sites, including airway, gastrointestinal, or genitourinary tract, may serve as potential origins of inflammation . Among them, the airway mucosa plays a critical role in the initiation of RA-related autoimmunity, as it is the site where the predisposing environmental factors interact with the host, resulting in local injury and triggering an inflammatory response . Constant alveolar epithelial injury and immune stimulation induced by RA trigger inflammatory responses in pulmonary tissue, resulting in infiltration of inflammatory cells into the interstitial and alveolar airspaces . Their activation and interactions, along with the participation of a wide profile of cytokines, are critical to the generation of abnormal fibroproliferative responses, as summarized in.Possible mechanisms of rheumatoid arthritis (A) and related interstitial lung disease (B). Pathogenesis of parenchymal lung involvement in RA includes participation and activation of diverse immune cells such as T cells, B cells, macrophages, neutrophils, and eosinophils. They contribute to joint damage and pulmonary fibrotic responses through the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Fibroblasts both at affected sites and circulation are involved in the self-sustaining of lung fibrosis. APC CELL_TYPE, antigen-presenting cells; IFN-γ, interferon-γ; TNF-α, RELT PROTEIN; CXCL5 PROTEIN, C-X-C motif ligand; MMP9 PROTEIN, MMP19 PROTEIN; TNFSF11 PROTEIN, receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand; EMT, epithelial-mesenchymal transition; FMT, fibroblast-to-myofibroblast transition; IL, CXCL8 PROTEIN; TGF-β, transforming growth factor-β; ECM, extracellular matrix; VEGF, VEGFA PROTEIN; PDGFC PROTEIN, PDGFA PROTEIN.One critical step in the development of interstitial fibrosis is related to activated fibroblasts and myofibroblasts resident within the lung, as well as recruitment of progenitor cells from blood circulation . Evidence from animal models suggested the localization and differentiation of circulating progenitor cells into fibrocytes, including mesenchymal stem cells and a monocyte lineage, contributing to the accumulation of SPON2 PROTEIN and tissue fibrosis . Additionally, the epithelial cells of lung tissue have been shown to participate in the profibrotic process via a mechanism known as epithelial–mesenchymal-transdifferentiation (EMT), during which they acquire mesenchymal characteristics and behaviors . This transition is upregulated in animal models of RA-ILD triggered by signals from the microenvironment, resulting in an increased profibrotic mesenchymal cell population (32, 33). Furthermore, fibroblast-myofibroblast transition (FMT) will then accelerate the process of fibrosis by translating activated fibroblasts into myofibroblasts, establishing a self-sustaining cycle .3. Activation of signaling pathways involved in RA and ILD 3.1. TGF-β/SMAD signaling pathway TGF-β signaling is an important pathway in fibrosis mechanism regulating response of tissue repair . Pleiotropic effects are mediated via three different types of TGF-β receptors, including TGFβRI, TGFβRII, and TGFβRIII . Dysregulation of TGF-β signaling has been implicated in disease development . In particular, over-activation of TGFβRI and TGFβRII can induce excessive COL5A2 PROTEIN accumulation and progressive fibrosis in pulmonary tissues (38, 39). Recent studies have revealed that the activation of TGF-β-SMAD2/3 signaling promotes EMT in lung fibrosis through establishing an animal model of RA-ILD mice . Furthermore, in another RA mouse model, pulmonary fibrosis can be reduced by inhibiting pathway of TGF-β/Smads signaling, during which proliferation and migration of RA synovial fibroblasts were also restricted . Insights from mechanism studies of autophagy also indicated that a decreased number of activated myofibroblasts can be induced by enhancing autophagy activity via inhibition of TGF-β1-Smad3/ERK/P38 signaling pathway . TGF-β inhibition therapy carries great expectations and are under investigation to improve safety and efficacy .Model of shared mechanistic pathways involved in both RA and ILD. Activation of TGF-β/SMAD, JAK/STAT, PI3K–Akt, Wnt/β-catenin, and NF-κB signaling pathways and resultant downstream reactions contribute to multiple biological process. Improved understanding of their roles in RA-ILD pathogenesis offers promising therapeutic targets. PIP PROTEIN, phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate; mTORC1, mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1; STAT, STAT1 PROTEIN; TCF/LEF, LEF1 PROTEIN; GSK3A PROTEIN, NEK3 PROTEIN; EMT, epithelial-mesenchymal transition.3.2. JAK/STAT signaling pathway JAK/STAT pathway can be activated by various cytokines and growth factors associated with fibrosis and inflammation, such as IL11 PROTEIN, IL6 PROTEIN, TGF-β1, and FGF12 PROTEIN (FGFs) (43, 44). It participates and mediates extensive biological processes, including cell differentiation and immune regulation, closely related to autoimmune disorders and fibrosis . The JAK/STAT signaling system is widely recognized as a key molecular mechanism in the etiology and development of RA, and it has emerged as a novel effective target in RA therapeutic strategies (46, 47). Given its involvement in several fibrotic disorders, there has been an interest in exploring its potential roles in ILDs . Several studies revealed that JAK2/STAT3 is the most common subtype in ILD, which participates in intercellular signal transduction in response to the stimulation of cytokines and growth factors (49, 50). RNA sequencing and immunohistostaining have provided evidence that JAK2 PROTEIN serves as a regulator and intermediator of TGF-β-mediated lung fibroblast responses in the development of RA-ILD with a usual interstitial pneumonia (RA-UIP) and IPF . In contrast, their findings suggested STAT5A PROTEIN as the downstream target in transcription, necessitating further investigation for clarification .3.3. PI3K–AKT1 PROTEIN signaling pathway The signaling pathway of PI3K-Akt has a great effect on cell activation and migration . In patients with ILD disease, it has been demonstrated to be aberrantly upregulated, contributing to tissue repair and disease progression . Enhanced activity of PI3K/AKT signaling pathway is related to synovial inflammation and osteoclasts proliferation in RA pathogenesis . PI3Kγ affects innate immunity of antigen-induced arthritis in the early phase by regulating downstream signal molecules, during which activated macrophage and neutrophil infiltrate into the joint . Research on PI3Kγ has also indicated that it may regulate synovial inflammation via fibroblasts, resulting in cartilage destruction . Impact of PI3K/AKT signaling pathway on osteoclast differentiation and generation may also contribute to aggravation of RA . Consequently, PIK3CA PROTEIN represents a viable therapeutic target for RA due to its central role in mediating inflammatory responses and bone destruction. Aberrant activation of PI3K/AKT has also been observed in IPF patients and demonstrated to play a central role in pathogenesis of the disease, which was considered as an effective therapeutic target against lung fibrosis (57, 58). Our research team has recently found that the CXCL16/CXCR axis can facilitate pulmonary fibrosis by activating PI3K/AKT/FOXO3a signaling pathway in human pulmonary fibroblasts, stimulating cell proliferation and COL5A2 PROTEIN production . Another study elucidated upregulation of PI3K-Akt signaling pathways in RA-ILD, based on network pharmacological and metabolic perspectives . Pharmacological inhibitors targeting PI3K/AKT pathway are presently being investigated in clinical trials for IPF treatment, demonstrating promising potential as innovative anti-fibrotic therapeutics .3.4. Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway Research on Wnt pathway in RA has suggested that it plays a role in synovial cell proliferation and bone homeostasis, promoting synovial hyperplasia and contributing to joint damage (61, 62). The Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway was significantly activated in IPF, with participation of a sequence of related ligands and receptors . Molecules involved in Wnt pathway, such as CCNO PROTEIN and MMP7 PROTEIN, were found to be over-expressed in lesions of pulmonary fibrosis . One study focusing on M2 macrophages indicated that inhibition against Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway may suppress myofibroblast differentiation and pulmonary fibrosis (65), suggesting that repurposing Wnt-targeting agents could hold promise for RA-ILD. Since shared Wnt signaling was involved in ILD and RA, a recent study investigated the clinical significance of a representative ligand Wnt5 in RA-ILD: Elevated levels of WNT5A PROTEIN were observed in patients with RA-ILD, especially in patients with UIP pattern . Accordingly, evaluation of circulating WNT5A PROTEIN may provide a potential candidate biomarker for early identification and progression assessment of RA-ILD . Furthermore, Wnt5a inhibitors or receptor antagonists could be explored to mitigate fibrotic progression in RA patients.3.5. NF-κB signaling pathway NF-κB signaling pathway is widely acknowledged for its role in the activation and differentiation of various immune cells, closely related to human inflammatory response . Dysregulated activation of NFYA PROTEIN promotes chronic inflammation and excessive proliferation of LERFS CELL_TYPE in RA (68, 69). Activated NF-κB members in the synovial tissue of RA patients can induce activation and differentiation of immune cells as well as the upregulation of various pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α, IFNA1 PROTEIN and IL17A PROTEIN, contributing to the aggregation of RA progression . It was also found in an animal model of lung fibrosis that fibroblast-to-myofibroblast differentiation, which contributes to aberrantly activated lung myofibroblasts and extracellular matrix accumulation, is dependent on the activation of NF-κB signaling . Moreover, one study supports IL17A PROTEIN of its direct role in stimulating positive responses of lung fibroblasts proliferation and extracellular matrix accumulation in RA-ILD pathogenesis via signaling mediated by NF-κB . Therapeutically, this underscores why NF-κB inhibition remains a key strategy in RA management, while new approaches are being explored to directly target this pathway and mitigate lung fibrosis.4. Biomarkers of clinical identification and monitoring Biomarkers correlated with RA-ILD development serve as useful tools for early screening and intervention guidance. Autoantibodies, cytokines, and novel biomarkers of other properties provide valuable guidance in screening and prediction of disease progression. ( Table 1 ) As a group of auto-antibodies widely used for early RA diagnosis, PRTN3 PROTEIN is also identified as a risk factor and strong predictor of RA-ILD (73, 74). It may become a useful serological biomarker to predict the presence and progression of lung fibrosis in RA patients (75, 76). Additionally, an elevated level of RF is also suggested to be associated with clinically evident and subclinical RA-ILD risk (75, 77). Recent studies indicate that the autoantibodies targeting citrullinated Hsp90α and HSP90AA1 CELL_LINE in patients with RA-ILD exhibit moderate sensitivity and great specificity in predicting RA-ILD progression .

The serum concentration of MMP-7 and CXCL10 PROTEIN was elevated in patients with RA-ILD compared with RA without ILD . Meanwhile, another research manifested a profile of biomarkers relating to lung disease, including MMP-7, activation-regulation chemokines, and surfactant protein D, which may be conducive to early diagnosis during the subclinical stage (81, 82). One study compared the profiling of serum proteins and demonstrated that lysyl oxidase-like 2 (LOXL2 PROTEIN) levels were significantly increased in RA individuals, especially in those patients with ILD duration less than three months . Krebs von den Lungen-6 (MUC1 PROTEIN) is a MUC2 PROTEIN associated with pulmonary fibrosis and is also a promising indicator for RA-ILD diagnosis and severity assessment (83, 84). It is noteworthy that, in addition to protein, other chemicals can also provide valuable information in disease monitoring. Evidence from the latest studies indicated uric acid can become a useful diagnostic biomarker in RA-UIP (85–87). Interestingly, a noticeable positive connection between microRNA, especially Hsa-miR-214-5p and has-miR-7-5p, and RA-ILD was also discovered recently, which exhibits prospectives in future studies .5. Existing therapies and safety concerns According to treatment algorithms for RA-ILD recently built by the ERS/EULAR clinical practice guidelines, pirfenidone is recommended for patients with UIP pattern and combination of immunosuppressive treatment is suggested in patients diagnosed with severe or progressive ILD . Moreover, nintedanib or combination of immunosuppressant and nintedanib is recommended for individuals with progressive pulmonary fibrosis . For RA-ILD with active arthritis, managing RA to target is of great importance. Currently, drug therapy for RA, such as conventional DMARDs (cDMARDS) and biologic DMARDs (bDMARDs) is widely recognized, while such effects may be balanced by higher risks of drug-related pulmonary disease . Until now, no evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) has been found to optimize RA-ILD patient management. ( Table 2 ). Table 2. Recent clinical trials of pharmacological interventions in RA-ILD. Intervention Trial name Phase Population Primary ending point Current status Pirfenidone TRAIL1(155) II RA-ILD Decline in FVC% from a baseline of 10% or more or death Completed DMARDs & pirfenidone NCT04928586 IV CTD-ILD Change in FVC and DLCo Active, not recruiting Pirfenidone & glucocorticoid & immunosuppressant NCT05505409 IV CTD-ILD Change in FVC% Recruiting Abatacept APRIL II RA-ILD Change of FVC Unknown status Nintedanib NCT05503030 Observational study CTD-ILD Change in FVC and dyspnoea symptom score Recruiting Tofacitinib RAILDTo II RA-ILD Incidence and severity of adverse events Recruiting Tofacitinib vs Methotrexate PULMORA IV RA-ILD Change in total score by HRCT Terminated Genakumab injection NCT06189495 II RA-ILD Change in FVC, DLCo, PGA, and adverse events Not yet recruiting N-acetylcysteine NCT01424033 II, III CTD-ILD Pulmonary Function Tests Terminated  DMARDs, disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs; CTD-ILD, connective tissue disease-associated interstitial lung disease; FVC, forced vital capacity; DLCo, diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide; HRCT, high resolution CT; PGA, patient global assessment.5.1. Methotrexate Methotrexate (MTX) is the anchor DMARD in treating RA patients . However, despite its significant efficacy and tolerability, a range of potential side effects, especially pulmonary toxicity, cannot be overlooked . It is conventionally believed that MTX is associated with a higher risk of adverse respiratory events, including fibrotic ILD . According to some retrospective studies, MTX is correlated with the occurrence or exacerbation of ILD, constituting as much as 7.6% of the ILD incidence . On the other hand, the direct causality of MTX and ILD remains undefined. According to one meta-analysis in 2021, MTX treatment is not associated with a higher risk of RA-ILD among RA patients . One Korean prospective cohort of RA-ILD patients also exhibits similar results, indicating that MTX does not contribute to the increased risk of ILD progression . Even better, recent evidence from a multi-center prospective cohort study suggested MTX can reduce the onset of ILD, supporting the beneficial role of MTX in RA-ILD . In addition, recently research has suggested that use of MTX is related to improvement and longer survival among RA-ILD patients . By contrast, prospective studies can avoid time-window bias, thereby providing stronger evidence of causality. Therefore, traditional view of correlations between MTX and ILD progression has been challenged.5.2. Biologic drugs 5.2.1. TNF PROTEIN inhibitors Currently, no guidelines have been established when deciding biologic agents or targeted therapies in RA-ILD patients. The efficiency of anti-TNF agents in alleviating articular and synovial damage is supported by previous studies, while their role in stabilizing RA-ILD remains controversial (99, 100). Numerous studies have demonstrated that no significant beneficial effects were seen between patients with RA-ILD treated with anti-TNF agents and other therapies (101, 102). Moreover, it is also suggested that a higher prevalence of ILD among RA patients is associated with TNF-inhibiting treatment . Results of one cohort study illustrated a lower survival rate of RA-ILD patients using TNFi as the first-line therapy by comparing their 5-year mortality rates with groups taking rituximab (RTX) as the first-line treatment . Another prospective case-control study has also demonstrated the exacerbation of ILD in cases treated with TNFi compared with non-TNFi biologic agents including tocilizumab and abatacept. Additionally, TNFi is indicated to be related to a higher incidence or development of ILD according to their finding . Therefore, given the current understanding, increased focus is necessary to ensure the efficacy and safety of biological therapy in RA-ILD patients .5.2.2. Rituximab, abatacept and tocilizumab Other bDMARDs, such as RTX and abatacept are more advised to be considered as alternatives in treating RA-ILD. According to a ten-year retrospective observational cohort conducted among 700 RA patients, RTX can serve as an acceptable therapeutic option with efficacy in stabilizing RA-ILD . Significant improvement in %-predicted FVC was found in RA patients with RA-ILD under rituximab treatment . Meanwhile, evidence from systemic review suggested a significant lower worsening rate of ILD under therapy of abatacept in RA-ILD compared with TNF PROTEIN inhibitors, which therefore would become a desirable alternative for RA-ILD patients . Moreover, one recent cohort study on tocilizumab declared that positive effects were shown in most RA-ILD patients during a 6-month period by monitoring biomarkers of both MMP-3 and MUC1 PROTEIN. However, it is noteworthy that condition of ILD can be worsened by respiratory infection after one year of tocilizumab therapy . Currently, ongoing clinical trials on RA-ILD are summarized in Table 2 . Due to the absence of prospective randomized controlled studies for further confirmation, more detailed therapeutic guidelines and recommendations are yet to be established.6. Pathway-targeted therapy 6.1. Targeting JAK/STAT signaling pathway JAK inhibitors, such as tofacitinib and baricitinib, are novel effective therapies in the treatment of RA (111, 112). Based on data from the most recent studies, JAKi shows great tolerance in RA-ILD patients and comparable efficacy and safety to bDMARDs including RTX and abatacept . Since they can alleviate the joint damage of RA patients by controlling serum inflammatory cytokines and exerting anti-fibrotic effects, they may also lead to clinical improvement in RA patients with ILD . One retrospective study examined the effectiveness of JAK inhibitors in patients with RA-ILD, among whom 83.9% of patients showed clinical stability or improvement after 18 months of treatment . Meanwhile, studies in 2019 demonstrated the pathogenic role of IL17A PROTEIN, which is a T helper 17 cytokine, involved in the pathogenesis of RA and pulmonary fibrosis. Their observations have supported the fibrogenic response in RA-ILD induced by IL17A PROTEIN, which can be significantly alleviated with the inhibition of JAK2 PROTEIN . Despite limited knowledge from clinical trials, tofacitinib, a JAK inhibitor, represents an effective anti-inflammatory therapeutic option for RA patients with lung involvement. Case reports have suggested that tofacitinib contributes to the stabilization of ILD in RA patients (116, 117). Recently, a large retrospective cohort consisting of 28,559 RA patients treated with tofacitinib showed a much lower incidence of ILD compared with patients treated with other bDMARDs, suggesting their significance in reducing risk of ILD in RA . Baricitinib, a JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor, was demonstrated to show promising effects in RA patients with interstitial lung involvement. In patients under baricitinib therapy, significant improvement in lung diffusion index and reduction of biomarkers was observed . Additionally, administration of JAK1 PROTEIN selective inhibitor upadacitinib in RA-ILD patients who were resistant to MTX and TNFi has shown improved outcomes, as reported by retrospective studies as well as individual cases (119, 120). However, safety concerns with JAKi are also noteworthy. Black box warnings have already been raised by FDA, attaching importance to increased risks of cardiovascular diseases, infection and cancer, inducing regulatory restrictions . According to evidence from clinical trials, adverse outcomes are more commonly observed in the elderly, or individuals with baseline cardiovascular risks, inflammation status and disease activity . Further investigations into JAK inhibitors as novel therapeutic options to treat RA-ILD patients as well as their safety profile will be of great significance.6.2. Other promising pathway-related therapeutic options Since shared molecular pathways exist in both RA and ILD, key molecules involved in signaling transduction may provide promising targets for developing novel therapeutic strategies for RA-ILD patients. PDE12 PROTEIN (PDE) inhibitors were found to exert a potent effect in anti-remodeling via inhibiting the target of the TGF-β1 signaling pathway against lung fibrosis . Given that they possess potent anti-inflammatory activities by modulating various immune cell functions, they are also considered a potential therapeutic strategy for RA (124, 125). Additionally, selective PDE4 inhibitors may also inhibiting the inflammatory reaction of RA-ILD via inhibition of NFE2L1 PROTEIN in PBMC . However, their effectiveness in RA-ILD lacks further evidence from experiments and clinical trials. PRTN3 PROTEIN has been associated with RA progression and RA-ILD exacerbation and PADI1 PROTEIN (PAD2) is an enzyme that catalyzes protein citrullination. Increased levels of PAD2 were detected in lung homogenates in RA-ILD subjects. SDC1 PROTEIN was associated with internalization and degradation of TGF-β receptor in alveolar epithelial cells and was determined to exert antifibrotic effects on RA-ILD fibroblasts by regulating PAD2 (55, 127). Evidence from mouse model confirmed that PAD2 can be downregulated by SDC1 PROTEIN through PI3K/Akt signaling in lung fibroblasts. MMP19 PROTEIN (MMP9 PROTEIN) is known as a proteolytic enzyme that promotes the formation of synovial pannus and cartilage destruction in RA. Anti-MMP9 antibody andecaliximab can alleviate pulmonary fibrosis via TGF-β1-induced SMAD2 PROTEIN phosphorylation blockade in mouse model, exhibiting beneficial effects in patients with higher expression of type 1 IFNs in particular . Its safety and effectiveness in RA patients have been assessed through a Phase1b clinical trial . Meanwhile, target analysis and molecular docking to explain the effectiveness of triptolide and tripterine in CTD-ILD intervention suggest PI3K-Akt was identified as one of the main signaling pathways in molecular mechanism (130, 131). Findings demonstrated that it participates in regulation of fibrotic extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling and therefore exhibits therapeutic value against pulmonary fibrosis . Paroxetine, a GRK2 PROTEIN inhibitor, was recently reported to suppress the activation of immune cells by inhibiting PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway in patients with RA . Since GRK2 PROTEIN is also involved in TGF-β1-induced activation of lung fibroblasts, paroxetine is demonstrated to produce therapeutic effects in pulmonary fibrosis . Further clinical trials of patient cohort will be warranted. Previous opinions have considered PTEN PROTEIN as a critical ZMYND10 PROTEIN and also a crucial protector against alveolar epithelial injury and pulmonary fibrosis by controlling the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway (135, 136). Current findings on PTEN PROTEIN in RA pathogenesis indicated that its aberrant function contributes to fibroblast-like synoviocyte activation and bone destruction, which offers new opportunities to discover potential therapeutic targets . DIS3 PROTEIN (EXOSC4 PROTEIN), a component of the RNA exosome complex, was identified to be a potential autoantigen for RA-ILD patients. Recent findings suggested that levels of EXOSC4 antibodies were found to be significantly increased in sera of RA-ILD patients and it may contribute to the pulmonary fibrotic process via activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway . Knockdown of EXOSC4 PROTEIN can inhibit the activity of Wnt/β-catenin pathway and regulate the proliferation and differentiation of ATII cells, which provide valuable insights into potential mechanisms and therapy. Currently, it already serves as a therapeutic target in colorectal and ovarian cancers (139, 140). Meanwhile, since Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway play a significant role in pulmonary fibrosis, other blockades of this pathway, including Calcaratarin D and Betulinic acid, were indicated to become novel antifibrotic agents for pulmonary fibrosis (141, 142). Osthole obtained from plants was estimated to restrain the function of RA-fibroblast-like synoviocytes through inhibition of NF-κB signaling, exerting a therapeutic effect in RA development. Meanwhile, by controlling accumulation and polarization of M2 macrophages in pulmonary interstitial fibrosis, it may also exhibit beneficial properties in RA patients with complications of ILD . Berberine has been reported with the potential to prevent RA and suppress inflammation through multiple signaling pathways, including Wnt/β-catenin, PI3K/Akt, and NF-κB . Its inhibitory effects to attenuate lung fibrosis through EMT and oxidative stress suppression as well as autophagy stimulation have also been confirmed by multiple relevant studies via animal models (145, 146). Further research and clinical trials on these pathway-related therapeutic targets exhibit great potential for improving the clinical outcomes of RA-ILD patients.7. Antifibrotic management Accumulating interest has been drawn to the application of antifibrotic medications against ILD progression, given the shared histological patterns and pathogenesis between IPF and RA-ILD. Pathways targeted by antifibrotic drugs, such as activation of TGF-β, WNT signal pathway and YAP/TAZ signal pathway, have become important strategies for fibrosis reduction . Novel therapeutic strategies focusing on the mechanism of fibrosis in RA-ILD, including nintedanib and pirfenidone, have recently been demonstrated to be promising in improving the outcomes of RA-ILD patients . Current viewpoints suggest the synergistic role of anti-fibrotic agents in treatment of RA-ILD combined with DMARDs. Evidence from the INBUILD trial has indicated that in groups treated with nintedanib, the rate of FVC decline was slower, both in patients with or without background therapy of DMARDs and/or glucocorticoids . Furthermore, it is suggested that compared with other fibrotic patterns, patients with UIP patterns shown by HRCT are more likely to benefit from nintedanib administration . However, patients under high-dose of immunosuppressive treatment were excluded from INBUILD probably due to safety concerns such as infection risks and hepatotoxicity. So far, data on high-dose combinations remain limited . Hepatotoxicity is one of the common adverse effects. An increase of ALT level over three times of the upper limit was reported in 15.1% patients treated with nintedanib . The potential effect of pirfenidone, another anti-fibrotic drug, was also being evaluated among RA-ILD patients. Similarly, studies recently have indicated their protective role against disease progression by slowing down FVC decline in RA-ILD patients . Pirfenidone can inhibit the transformation of fibroblasts into myofibroblasts and result in the reduction of critical cytokines involved in RA pathogenesis, including IL6 PROTEIN and TNFRSF1A PROTEIN (153, 154). While discontinuations have been reported in TRAIL1 due to adverse effects on gastrointestinal system (24.8%) . Other side effects include incidences of photosensitivity (12%) and rash (32%) in randomized trials . Further studies on antifibrotic drugs will be necessary to clarify their efficacy and safety in RA-ILD treatment. As for recent progress in cell therapy, rapid clinical improvement was observed in cases using CD19-targeting CAR-T cell therapy in treatment of CTD-ILD refractory to traditional immunosuppressive therapies . Last but not least, development of drug delivery systems based on RNAs, oligonucleotides, exosomes, and stem cells against pulmonary fibrosis is also worth noticing . For instance, one study developed mesenchymal stem cell-derived extracellular vesicles to treat pulmonary fibrosis by targeting senescent alveolar epithelial cells .8. Conclusions This review summarized the latest advances in RA-ILD, addressing the unsolved issues with great significance to inform future directions. Refined knowledge of the mechanistic interplay suggested a potential linkage of RA and ILD pathogenesis, involving multiple contributing factors. Meanwhile, progress in understanding the convergence of immunological pathways will contribute to a shared paradigm in patient management with considerations for both articular damage and the risk of lung fibrosis. Evidence of clinical evaluation from biomarkers is meaningful to allow for early identification from subclinical conditions, thereby predicting disease progression and guiding algorithms of optimal management. Currently, targeted therapies for RA treatment and their safety profile are being considered within clinical trials, while data regarding their use in RA-ILD as well as other efficacious options against pulmonary fibrosis are still limited. An urgent need remains for more studies on pathway-targeted therapeutic strategies to search for underlying opportunities that improve the overall outcomes of RA-ILD patients. Future research should prioritize the clinical validation of novel targeted therapies and exploration of combination therapies that concurrently address inflammation and fibrosis. By integrating these approaches, we can advance toward more effective, personalized treatment strategies that transform the management paradigm of RA-ILD.Acknowledgments We would like to thank Biorender.com for visual support.Funding Statement The author(s) declare financial support was received for the research and/or publication of this article.

Constitutive activation of the STAT1 PROTEIN signaling pathway in MF leads to cell proliferation, inhibition of cell death, and clonal expansion of myeloproliferative malignant cells. Fedratinib is a selective oral JAK2 PROTEIN inhibitor recently approved in the United States for treatment of adult patients with intermediate-2 or high-risk MF. In mouse models of JAK2V617F-driven myeloproliferative disease, fedratinib blocked phosphorylation of STAT5A PROTEIN, increased survival, and improved MF-associated disease features, including reduction of white blood cell counts, hematocrit, splenomegaly, and fibrosis. Fedratinib exerts off-target inhibitory activity against BRD4 PROTEIN (BRD4 DNA); combination JAK/STAT and BRD4 PROTEIN inhibition was shown to synergistically block NFKB2 PROTEIN hyperactivation and CCL1 PROTEIN production, attenuating disease burden and reversing bone marrow fibrosis in animal models of MPNs. In patients, fedratinib is rapidly absorbed and dosed once daily (effective half-life 41 h). Fedratinib showed robust clinical activity in JAK-inhibitor-naïve patients and in patients with MF who were relapsed, refractory, or intolerant to prior ruxolitinib therapy. Fedratinib is effective regardless of JAK2 PROTEIN mutation status. Onset of spleen and symptom responses are typically seen within the first 1–2 months of treatment. The most common adverse events (AEs) with fedratinib are grades 1–2 gastrointestinal events, which are most frequent during early treatment and decrease over time. Treatment discontinuation due to hematologic AEs in clinical trials was uncommon (~3%). Suspected cases of Wernicke’s encephalopathy were reported during fedratinib trials in ~1% of patients; thiamine levels should be monitored before and during fedratinib treatment\\n\\nare typically seen within the first 1–2 months of treatment. The most common adverse events (AEs) with fedratinib are grades 1–2 gastrointestinal events, which are most frequent during early treatment and decrease over time. Treatment discontinuation due to hematologic AEs in clinical trials was uncommon (~3%). Suspected cases of Wernicke’s encephalopathy were reported during fedratinib trials in ~1% of patients; thiamine levels should be monitored before and during fedratinib treatment as medically indicated. Phase III trials are ongoing to assess fedratinib effects on long-term safety, efficacy, and overall survival. The recent approval of fedratinib provides a much-needed addition to the limited therapeutic options available for patients with MF. Subject terms: Drug development, Myeloproliferative diseaseIntroduction Myelofibrosis (MF) is a life-threatening condition characterized by hematopoietic stem-cell-derived clonal proliferation, abnormal IL9 PROTEIN production, bone marrow fibrosis, anemia, splenomegaly, a large array of symptoms, extramedullary hematopoiesis, leukemic progression, and shortened survival  MF can appear de novo (primary MF) or secondary to polycythemia vera (PV) or essential thrombocythemia (ET)  MF symptoms related to splenomegaly (abdominal distension and pain, early satiety, splenic infarction, dyspnea, and diarrhea), constitutional symptoms (fatigue, cachexia, pruritus, bone pain, weight loss, night sweats, and fever) and anemia significantly compromise patients’ quality-of-life  Janus kinase 2 (JAK2 PROTEIN) has an essential role in signaling of normal hematopoiesis. The somatic JAK2V617F activating mutation is found in 50–60% of patients with primary MF and ET, and in 95% of patients with PV  JAK2V617F constitutively activates the JAK/STAT signaling pathway, resulting in cell proliferation and clonal expansion of myeloid malignant cells  Mutations that cause abnormal activation of MPL PROTEIN (MPL, the THPO PROTEIN) are the founding\\n\\nfibrosis had stabilized or improved from baseline in 15/18 evaluable patients by the end of 6 treatment cycles, and in 4/9 patients by cycle 30. Two patients showed complete resolution of bone marrow fibrosis by cycle 12 of fedratinib treatment  These findings require confirmation in blinded review by expert pathologists in larger patient populations. Interestingly, a recent study in an animal model of acute liver injury supports the putative anti-fibrotic effects of fedratinib: in a mouse model of CCl4-induced hepatic injury, fedratinib attenuated COL5A2 PROTEIN accumulation and hepatic stellate cell activation, and reduced inflammatory macrophage infiltration and activation in the liver in vivo, resulting in decreased intrahepatic inflammation and fibrogenesis Early dose-finding studies Clinical use of fedratinib was first evaluated in a phase I dose-escalation study in 59 patients with intermediate or high-risk primary, post-PV, or post -ET MF (TED12037; NCT00631462)  Doses ranged from 30 to 800 mg/day, administered in consecutive 4-week cycles. The lowest fedratinib dose with clinical activity was 240 mg and the maximum tolerated dose was 680 mg/day  The dose-limiting toxicity was an asymptomatic grades 3–4 increase in serum amylase in 2/6 patients that reversed upon treatment cessation. The most common AEs were mainly grade 1 gastrointestinal events; grade 3 nausea, diarrhea, and vomiting were reported for 3%, 10%, and 3% of all patients, respectively, and were dose-dependent, reported almost exclusively at fedratinib doses at or above 680 mg/day. Grades 3–4 treatment-related hematologic AEs included anemia (13/37 non-transfusion-dependent patient at baseline , thrombocytopenia (24%,) and neutropenia (10%), with most occurring in the first three fedratinib treatment cycles. Of the 13 patients who developed grades 3–4 anemia (all in the 680 mg dosing cohort), two-thirds (67%) had grade 2 anemia at study entry and 9 of 14 patients who developed grades 3–4\\n\\nreported almost exclusively at fedratinib doses at or above 680 mg/day. Grades 3–4 treatment-related hematologic AEs included anemia (13/37 non-transfusion-dependent patient at baseline , thrombocytopenia (24%,) and neutropenia (10%), with most occurring in the first three fedratinib treatment cycles. Of the 13 patients who developed grades 3–4 anemia (all in the 680 mg dosing cohort), two-thirds (67%) had grade 2 anemia at study entry and 9 of 14 patients who developed grades 3–4 thrombocytopenia had grades 1–2 thrombocytopenia at baseline. Serious AEs considered at least possibly related to fedratinib occurred in eight patients, and included asymptomatic hyperlipasemia, thrombocytopenia/neutropenia, depression, tumor lysis syndrome, cerebrovascular accident, and dehydration  Onset of spleen response was generally seen within the first 2 months of fedratinib treatment. Of patients who completed 6 months of fedratinib, 61% achieved a ≥25% reduction in palpable spleen size and 39% had a ≥50% reduction that persisted for ≥8 weeks. Of 28 patients who entered the trial with leukocytosis (WBC count > 11 × 109/L), 16 patients (57%) achieved normal WBC counts after 6 months of fedratinib treatment. Similarly, 9 of 10 patients (90%) who entered the trial with thrombocytosis (platelet count > 450 × 109/L) attained normal platelet counts  This study, which began in 2008, included a long-term open extension phase (TED12015; NCT00724334) that currently provides the longest reported exposure to fedratinib therapy. At a reported follow-up in 2011, 23 of the original 59 patients (39%) remained on fedratinib treatment  the median number of fedratinib cycles received was 30 (range 13–44) and the median current fedratinib dose was 440 mg/day. Proportions of patients with a ≥50% reduction in spleen size were 54% at 6 months (n = 57); 67% at 12 months (n = 42); 53% at 18 months (n = 36); 55% at 24 months (n = 31); and 61% at 30 months (n = 18)  In a phase II randomized, dose-finding\\n\\nto several changes including increased NF-κB signaling via chromatin changes that contribute to MPN-associated inflammation  In an MPN animal model, JQ1, a potent BET inhibitor, and ruxolitinib, each given alone, attenuated NF-κB activation and reduced CCL1 PROTEIN production. However, combining JQ1 and ruxolitinib produced synergistic therapeutic effects, leading to substantial reductions in plasma levels of MROCKI PROTEIN, reduced disease burden, and reversed bone marrow fibrosis in vivo  Unlike ruxolitinib, which has not exhibited inhibitory activity against bromodomains, fedratinib has potent dual activity against JAK2 PROTEIN and BRD4 PROTEIN  and fedratinib monotherapy has been shown to reduce CCL1 PROTEIN levels in patients with MF and may ameliorate bone marrow fibrosis  Combination therapy with the specific BET inhibitor, CPI-0610, and ruxolitinib, and CPI-0610 monotherapy are currently under evaluation in a phase II, open-label clinical trial in patients with MF who are JAK-inhibitor naïve or refractory or intolerant to prior ruxolitinib treatment  Observed IL9 PROTEIN regulation during fedratinib treatment, including downregulation of pro-inflammatory TNF-α, may contribute to improvements in MF symptoms, and upregulation of anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic adiponectin may affect bone marrow fibrosis  The effect of fedratinib on JAK2V617F allele burden is uncertain, with some data suggesting activity against the malignant clone and other findings suggesting no noticeable effects  These findings warrant further study in larger patient populations. Because the JAK/STAT signaling pathway is implicated in cancer cell development and survival, and in chronic inflammation, fedratinib may also have utility in other diseases  As mentioned, fedratinib-induced inhibition of activated hepatic stellate cells and inflammatory macrophage infiltration in vivo suggests a potential therapeutic role for fedratinib in hepatic fibrosis  Dysregulated JAK/STAT signaling may\\n\\nof drug-related WE, a rare neurological disorder induced by a deficiency of thiamine (vitamin B1). Among the more than 600 patients treated with multiple fedratinib doses in clinical trials, 8 (1.3%) potential cases of WE were reported and 1 case (0.16%) was fatal  Most events resolved with some residual neurological symptoms. Retrospective analysis of potential WE events suggested that affected patients experienced predisposing conditions known to lead to WE in any population (e.g., underlying malnutrition and uncontrolled gastrointestinal events)  The clinical hold was lifted in August 2017 after additional safety information was provided to the FDA. The fedratinib prescribing information includes a “black box” warning of the potential for encephalopathy, including WE, during fedratinib treatment. Patients should have normal thiamine levels before starting fedratinib, and thiamine monitoring periodically during treatment as clinically indicated is recommended Discussion The recent approval of fedratinib provides a much-needed addition to the limited therapeutic options available for transplant-ineligible patients with intermediate- or high-risk MF. In both JAK-inhibitor-naïve patients and those previously treated with ruxolitinib, fedratinib induced spleen reductions and improved MF symptom burden. Many patients with MF have benefited from spleen size reductions and symptom improvements with ruxolitinib therapy  However, as many as one-half of ruxolitinib-treated patients require dose reductions or interruptions  often because of cytopenias, and recommended dosing for patients with pretreatment platelet counts < 100 × 109/L (5 mg BID  may induce suboptimal responses  Moreover, a majority of patients discontinue ruxolitinib within 3–5 years  Prognosis for patients with MF who discontinue ruxolitinib is poor, with median survival ranging from 6 to 14 months  Fedratinib may fulfill an important unmet need for patients who have discontinued ruxolitinib due to\\n\\nto fedratinib therapy. At a reported follow-up in 2011, 23 of the original 59 patients (39%) remained on fedratinib treatment  the median number of fedratinib cycles received was 30 (range 13–44) and the median current fedratinib dose was 440 mg/day. Proportions of patients with a ≥50% reduction in spleen size were 54% at 6 months (n = 57); 67% at 12 months (n = 42); 53% at 18 months (n = 36); 55% at 24 months (n = 31); and 61% at 30 months (n = 18)  In a phase II randomized, dose-finding study , 31 patients with intermediate-2 or high-risk MF received fedratinib 300 mg (n = 10), 400 mg (n = 10), or 500 mg (n = 11) per day in 28-day cycles for up to 48 weeks  The median numbers of fedratinib cycles received were 13.0 (range 2–16), 14.0 (6–16), and 13.0 (7–17) in the 300 mg, 400 mg, and 500 mg dosing arms, respectively. At week 24, mean [±standard deviation] reductions in spleen volume relative to baseline for the intention-to-treat (ITT) population were –26.6%  –37.2%  and –41.1% in the fedratinib 300 mg, 400 mg, and 500 mg daily dose groups, respectively, and spleen volume response rates (SVRR; the proportion of patients who achieved a ≥35% decrease in spleen volume from baseline as measured by MRI) were 30, 60, and 55%  At week 48, SVRRs were 30% in the fedratinib 300 mg/day arm, 80% in the fedratinib 400 mg/day arm, and 45% in the fedratinib 500 mg/day arm. The study was not powered to detect statistical differences in SVRRs among the three dosing groups. Grade 3 or grade 4 treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs) were reported for 8/10 patients in the 300 mg dose group, 8/10 in the 400 mg dose group, and for all 11 patients in the 500 mg dose group. The most frequent hematologic abnormality was anemia, which was reported for all 31 patients; grades 3–4 anemia occurred in 60%, 50%, and 64% of patients in the fedratinib 300 mg, 400 mg, and 500 mg/day dosing arms, respectively. In the fedratinib 300 mg and 400 mg dose groups, mean HBB PROTEIN levels reached nadir at ~12–16\\n\\nimproving symptom burden.IL9 PROTEIN regulation by fedratinib.  a Hierarchical clustering of patients by changes in the 22 regulated cytokines at week 4; b Correlation between changes in levels of ADIPOQ PROTEIN and TNFRSF1A PROTEIN and reduction in spleen volume Ruxolitinib also suppresses CCL1 PROTEIN production  though fedratinib and ruxolitinib may do so via different mechanisms. Many pro-inflammatory cytokines signal through JAK1-dependent cellular pathways, and the suppressive effect of ruxolitinib on MROCKI PROTEIN may be linked to its inhibitory activity against JAK1 PROTEIN  JAK1 PROTEIN inhibition also negatively affects T-cell signaling capacity and proliferation  factors that may directly contribute to the variety of infectious complications seen with ruxolitinib. Specificity for JAK2 PROTEIN inhibition with fedratinib may reduce the incidence of infectious events due to less immunosuppression  Fedratinib is a weaker inhibitor of JAK1 PROTEIN and downregulation of inflammatory mediators more likely reflects its inhibition of BRD4 PROTEIN and BET proteins, and consequent attenuation of NF-κB hyperactivation Anti-fibrotic effects In the extension phase of a phase I dose-ranging study in patients with MF receiving fedratinib doses of 120–680 mg per day in consecutive 4-week cycles (median daily dose 489.6 mg), bone marrow samples were collected before fedratinib treatment, at the end of treatment cycle 6, and following each additional 6 cycles of therapy  Bone marrow fibrosis had stabilized or improved from baseline in 15/18 evaluable patients by the end of 6 treatment cycles, and in 4/9 patients by cycle 30. Two patients showed complete resolution of bone marrow fibrosis by cycle 12 of fedratinib treatment  These findings require confirmation in blinded review by expert pathologists in larger patient populations. Interestingly, a recent study in an animal model of acute liver injury supports the putative anti-fibrotic effects of fedratinib: in a mouse\\n\\n46 bromodomains outside the DNER PROTEIN showed fedratinib also interacted with bromodomains of H4C12 PROTEIN acetyl transferases. Fedratinib potently suppressed MYC PROTEIN expression (a well-established marker of BET inhibition) in MM.1S multiple myeloma cells; in contrast, MYC PROTEIN was not suppressed by selective JAK inhibitors that lacked BET activity, including ruxolitinib Pharmacokinetics A randomized, placebo-controlled, phase I study in healthy volunteers was conducted to assess the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and tolerability of single fedratinib doses ranging from 10 to 680 mg  Fedratinib was rapidly absorbed, reaching peak plasma concentrations at 2–3 h after initial dosing. Fedratinib exposure appeared to increase in a greater than dose‐proportional manner, with an increase in exposure in the 80–500 mg dose range ~3-fold higher than would be expected with dose proportionality  Similarly, in patients with MF receiving fedratinib doses of 30–800 mg/day, mean steady-state maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and area under the concentration-time curve (AUC0-t) values increased ~54- and 88-fold, respectively, over the 27-fold increase in dose  The bioavailability of fedratinib is minimally impacted by food, and it can be taken with or without a meal  Fedratinib has an effective half-life of 41 h  Steady-state fedratinib plasma concentrations were achieved by day 15 of treatment  Fedratinib is metabolized by CYP3A4, CYP2C19, and FMO3; co-administration with strong or moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole) may increase fedratinib exposure  After oral administration, fedratinib accounts for approximately 80% of total circulating drug in plasma, and following a single oral dose, 77% of the administered dose (23% unchanged) was excreted in feces and 5% (3% unchanged) was eliminated in urine  No clinically meaningful effect of age, race, sex, body weight, or mild-to-moderate renal or hepatic impairment on PK parameters has been observed with\\n\\nJAK2 PROTEIN inhibitors is shown to reduce MF-associated splenomegaly and symptom burden  Until recently, ruxolitinib, a dual JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor that was approved by the United States (US) Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2011, was the only available drug indicated for treatment of intermediate- and high-risk MF  Evidence suggests there may be a survival benefit with ruxolitinib compared with conventional therapies  However, many patients treated with ruxolitinib lose response, have a suboptimal response, or develop cytopenias during treatment, resulting in ruxolitinib discontinuation within a few months and subsequent risk of disease rebound  In the phase III COMFORT-I and COMFORT-II trials, pooled ruxolitinib discontinuation rates at 3 and 5 years were ~50% and ~70%, respectively  Suboptimal ruxolitinib dosing to avoid treatment-related adverse events (AEs), at least initially  appears to be relatively common  Fedratinib (INREBIC®; formerly TG101348/SAR302503) is an oral, potent JAK2 PROTEIN inhibitor with activity against wild-type and mutationally activated JAK2 PROTEIN and FLT3 PROTEIN. In August 2019, the US FDA approved fedratinib for treatment of adult patients with intermediate-2 or high-risk primary or secondary MF  The National Comprehensive Care Network (NCCN) clinical practice guidelines for treatment of MPNs now includes fedratinib as an option for patients with intermediate-2 or high-risk MF with platelet counts ≥50 × 109/L, used as initial therapy or as second-line therapy for patients previously treated with ruxolitinib  The clinical activity of fedratinib in MF, at the recommended starting dose of 400 mg/day has been assessed in JAK-inhibitor-naïve patients and in patients previously treated with ruxolitinib  Here, we present a comprehensive overview of fedratinib pharmacology, clinical development, efficacy, safety, and AE management strategies, and a description of ongoing clinical investigations of fedratinib in patients previously\\n\\n4 treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs) were reported for 8/10 patients in the 300 mg dose group, 8/10 in the 400 mg dose group, and for all 11 patients in the 500 mg dose group. The most frequent hematologic abnormality was anemia, which was reported for all 31 patients; grades 3–4 anemia occurred in 60%, 50%, and 64% of patients in the fedratinib 300 mg, 400 mg, and 500 mg/day dosing arms, respectively. In the fedratinib 300 mg and 400 mg dose groups, mean HBB PROTEIN levels reached nadir at ~12–16 weeks from treatment initiation, then tended to increase to baseline or above-baseline levels by week 48. Mean HBB PROTEIN levels were lower in the fedratinib 500 mg/day dosing group during treatment. Thus, results of early dose-finding studies supported an initial 400 mg daily fedratinib dose as having the optimal risk-benefit profile for treatment of MF Efficacy in pivotal trials JAKARTA The pivotal phase III, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled JAKARTA trial evaluated the safety and efficacy of once-daily fedratinib 400 or 500 mg vs. placebo in 28-day cycles, in JAK-inhibitor-naïve patients with MF. Regulatory approval of the recommended fedratinib 400 mg daily dose for treatment of patients with intermediate-2 or high-risk MF in the United States was based in large part on the clinical efficacy and safety of the 400 mg dose in the JAKARTA trial  Key eligibility criteria included primary or secondary (post-PV or post-ET) MF, intermediate-2 or high-risk disease, palpable splenomegaly, platelet count ≥ 50 × 109/L, and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status score of ≤2  The primary end point was SVRR, the proportion of patients who achieved a ≥35% reduction in spleen volume from baseline (confirmed by MRI/CT) at the end of cycle 6 (EOC6), confirmed 4 weeks later. A key secondary endpoint was symptom response rate, defined as the proportion of patients who achieved a ≥50% decrease in total symptom score (TSS) on the modified\\n\\nPatients with greater reductions in STAT3 PROTEIN levels were more likely to achieve a spleen response during fedratinib treatment  JAK2V617F Fedratinib has demonstrated activity against cells expressing JAK2V617F in animal models  The effect of fedratinib on JAK2V617F allele burden in patients with MF is less clear. In a multicenter, phase I study of fedratinib at doses ranging from 30 to 800 mg daily in 59 patients with intermediate- or high-risk MF, significant decreases in JAK2V617F variant allele frequency (VAF) were observed at 6 cycles (P = 0.04) and 12 cycles (P = 0.01) in JAK2-mutated patients (n = 51), suggesting direct activity against the malignant clone  In that study, reductions in JAK2V617F VAF were more pronounced in patients with higher mutation burden at baseline: following 24 cycles of fedratinib treatment, patients who began the study with a VAF > 20% showed a persistent decrease in the median percentage JAK2V617F mutant allele burden compared with baseline (21% vs. 60% at baseline; P = 0.03)  In contrast, in a phase II study of 31 patients with MF treated with fedratinib doses of 300, 400, or 500 mg daily, no consistent change in JAK2V617F allele burden was observed during the course of treatment IL9 PROTEIN expression Abnormal IL9 PROTEIN expression is thought to contribute to MF-related bone marrow stromal changes, ineffective erythropoiesis, extramedullary hematopoiesis, and constitutional symptoms  In the phase II dose-finding study mentioned above, plasma levels of 28 cytokines (among 97 cytokines screened) were significantly modulated (≥1.5-fold change; P < 0.05, adjusted for multiple comparisons) compared with baseline over the first 12 weeks of fedratinib treatment  The highest level of upregulation occurred in erythropoietin, FTH1 PROTEIN, adiponectin, and leptin; the greatest downregulation occurred in C-reactive protein, the CCL5 PROTEIN (regulated upon activation normal T-cell expressed), and the S100A12 PROTEIN for advanced\\n\\n10 0 4.2 0 Alanine aminotransferase increased 9 0 1.1 0 Headache 9 0 1.1 0 Weight increased 9 0 4.2 0 Dizziness 8 0 3.2 0 Bone pain 8 0 2.1 0 Urinary tract infectionc 6 0 1.1 0 Dysuria 6 0 0 0 Aspartate aminotransferase increased 5 0 1.1 0 Selected laboratory abnormalities Hematology Anemia 74 34 32 10 Thrombocytopenia 47 12 26 10 Neutropenia 23 5 13 3.3 Biochemistry Creatinine increased 59 3.1 19 1.1 ALT increased 43 1 14 0 AST increased 40 0 16 1.1 Lipase increased 35 10 7 2.2 Hyponatremia 26 5 11 4.3 Amylase increased 24 2.1 5 0  aOnly 1 Grade 4 event (anemia). bCTCAE version 4.03. cIncludes cystitis. Laboratory-assessed anemia and thrombocytopenia occurred at higher rates with fedratinib 400 mg than with placebo (Table 3)  New or worsening grade 3 anemia occurred in 34% of patients treated with fedratinib 400 mg, with median time to onset of ~2 months, and 75% of cases occurring within 3 months. Mean HBB PROTEIN levels reached nadir after 12–16 weeks with partial recovery and stabilization after 16 weeks  Permanent discontinuation of fedratinib 400 mg due to anemia occurred in 1% of patients. New or worsening grade ≥ 3 thrombocytopenia during the randomized treatment period occurred in 12% of fedratinib-treated patients, with median time to onset of ~1 month and 75% of cases occurring within 4 months. Permanent discontinuation of treatment due to thrombocytopenia and bleeding that required clinical intervention both occurred in 2.1% of INREBIC-treated patients JAKARTA2 In the phase II, single-arm JAKARTA2 study in patients previously treated with ruxolitinib, 33% of patients began the study with platelet counts < 100 × 109/L and 53% had baseline HBB PROTEIN concentrations <10 g/dL. Grades 3–4 anemia and thrombocytopenia were more commonly reported in patients with low baseline platelet counts: 46% and 49% of patients with platelet counts < 100 × 109/L experienced grades 3–4 anemia and thrombocytopenia, respectively, vs. 34% and 8% of patients with platelet\\n\\ndisease, palpable splenomegaly, platelet count ≥ 50 × 109/L, and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status score of ≤2  The primary end point was SVRR, the proportion of patients who achieved a ≥35% reduction in spleen volume from baseline (confirmed by MRI/CT) at the end of cycle 6 (EOC6), confirmed 4 weeks later. A key secondary endpoint was symptom response rate, defined as the proportion of patients who achieved a ≥50% decrease in total symptom score (TSS) on the modified Myelofibrosis Symptom Assessment Form (MFSAF  from baseline to EOC6. In the placebo arm, patients were treated for 6 months or until disease progression, after which they could crossover to fedratinib treatment. Of all 289 patients enrolled, a total of 96 patients in JAKARTA were randomized to receive fedratinib 400 mg and 96 patients were randomized to placebo (1 patient did not receive placebo and was not included in safety analyses). Baseline characteristics are shown in Supplementary Table 1. The total median duration of exposure to fedratinib 400 mg daily in the JAKARTA trial was 15.5 months  SVRR at EOC6 with a follow-up scan 4 weeks later was 37% in the fedratinib 400 mg arm and 1% in the placebo arm (P < 0.0001) Responses were durable; median duration of spleen volume response in the fedratinib 400 mg arm was 18.2 months  In subgroup analyses, achievement of spleen responses with fedratinib was not appreciably affected by JAK2 PROTEIN mutational status, MF disease subtype, disease risk status, or baseline platelet count greater than or less than 100 × 109/L  No meaningful changes were detected in JAK2V617F allele burden in any treatment arm at 24 weeks.Spleen volume response.

Patients with greater reductions in STAT3 PROTEIN levels were more likely to achieve a spleen response during fedratinib treatment  JAK2V617F Fedratinib has demonstrated activity against cells expressing JAK2V617F in animal models  The effect of fedratinib on JAK2V617F allele burden in patients with MF is less clear.

Because the JAK/STAT signaling pathway is implicated in cancer cell development and survival, and in chronic inflammation, fedratinib may also have utility in other diseases  As mentioned, fedratinib-induced inhibition of activated hepatic stellate cells and inflammatory macrophage infiltration in vivo suggests a potential therapeutic role for fedratinib in hepatic fibrosis  Dysregulated JAK/STAT signaling may be involved in resistance mechanisms against molecularly targeted drugs  In vitro, fedratinib significantly enhanced the cytotoxicity of erlotinib in erlotinib-resistant non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) cells with ERBB2 PROTEIN mutations, and inhibited tumor growth of erlotinib-resistant NSCLC cells in vivo  Effective management of fedratinib-related TEAEs can facilitate long-term therapy. Hematologic events are anticipated with JAK2 PROTEIN inhibitors due to their mechanism of action  These events typically occur within the first 3–4 months of initiating fedratinib therapy and hematology counts tend to improve over time during treatment  Grades 3–4 laboratory abnormalities of anemia and thrombocytopenia were more frequent in the JAKARTA2 study in patients previously treated with ruxolitinib than in the JAKARTA trial, as might be expected for patients with more advanced disease and who were more likely to have low platelet counts and HBB PROTEIN concentrations at study entry  In both studies, permanent discontinuation of fedratinib due to these events was infrequent (2–3%), suggesting that these events could be managed effectively while continuing fedratinib treatment. Hematologic TEAEs can be managed with supportive interventions, including transfusions, and fedratinib dose modifications may be needed if supportive interventions are insufficient.

The median overall survival was 9.5 months similar to treatment with an HMA alone  Interestingly, ruxolitinib may have a role in alleviating symptoms and improving performance status in patients who are allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) transplant candidates. In a case report of six patients who got ruxolitinib in combination with intensive chemotherapy, three patients underwent allo-HSCT  There is also an ongoing clinical trial evaluating the role of decitabine in combination with a JAK-inhibitor as a bridge to allo-HSCT . Fedratinib is a selective oral JAK2 PROTEIN inhibitor approved for the treatment of adults with intermediate or high-risk myelofibrosis. In preclinical models, fedratinib blocked phosphorylation of the STAT5A PROTEIN pathway and was found to exert off target inhibitory activity against BRD4 PROTEIN (BRD4 DNA), which, in turn, was found to attenuate disease burden and reverse bone marrow fibrosis  There is an ongoing phase II study  evaluating the use of fedratinib with decitabine before transplant in patients with accelerated/blast phase MPN.BH3-mimetics/BCL-2 inhibitors Venetoclax (ABT-199), a BH3-mimetic and highly selective protein B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL2 CELL_LINE) inhibitor, was approved in November 2018 by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of AML in adult patients aged 75 years or older, or unable to tolerate intensive induction chemotherapy, in combination with either hypomethylating agents or low-dose cytarabine  While the use of venetoclax has shown benefit in de novo AML and secondary AML (MRC or therapy related), its effect is unclear in patients with post-MPN AML. It is suggested that cells chronically treated with JAK2 PROTEIN reversibly hyperactivated the JAK2/STAT5 signaling axis, with increased expression of BCL2L1 PROTEIN, and surprisingly, decreased levels of BCL2 PROTEIN. This can confer resistance to venetoclax.\\n\\nespecially in an already malnourished individual  Preclinical studies of fedratinib at clinically relevant concentrations have shown fedratinib does not have an effect on the thiamine receptor function in the gastrointestinal tract or the brain  However, because gastrointestinal events are common, proactive management of nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea may help prevent thiamine deficiency during fedratinib treatment and risk-mitigation strategies for Wernicke’s encephalopathy, including routine monitoring of thiamine as appropriate, are recommended for patients with MF receiving fedratinib  Because of the clinical hold, long-term data for fedratinib are limited. Two phase III clinical trials, FREEDOM  and FREEDOM2 , are currently underway to evaluate the long-term safety, efficacy, and effect on overall survival of fedratinib 400 mg/day in patients with intermediate-2 or high-risk MF previously treated with ruxolitinib. FREEDOM is a single-arm trial and FREEDOM2 is a randomized trial that compares fedratinib with best available therapy (BAT). Both studies employ risk-mitigation strategies for Wernicke’s encephalopathy and proactive management of gastrointestinal events to prevent thiamine deficiency. Fedratinib is a promising new therapy for patients with advanced MF who until recently have had limited treatment options. More extensive clinical experience with fedratinib is needed to determine the duration of spleen response during treatment, the potential to develop secondary resistance, and whether biomarkers may identify a subset of patients with MF most likely to respond to the drug.Supplementary information Supplementary File (181.9KB, pdf)\\n\\nIn the phase II, single-arm JAKARTA2 study in patients previously treated with ruxolitinib, 33% of patients began the study with platelet counts < 100 × 109/L and 53% had baseline HBB PROTEIN concentrations <10 g/dL. Grades 3–4 anemia and thrombocytopenia were more commonly reported in patients with low baseline platelet counts: 46% and 49% of patients with platelet counts < 100 × 109/L experienced grades 3–4 anemia and thrombocytopenia, respectively, vs. 34% and 8% of patients with platelet counts ≥ 100 × 109/L. Supplementary Table 3 shows the most common TEAEs and selected laboratory abnormalities. Treatment interruptions of ≥7 days occurred in 26% of patients and fedratinib dose-reduction occurred in 26%. The most common TEAEs requiring dose-interruption or dose-reduction were nausea (8%), anemia (8%), diarrhea (7%), and thrombocytopenia (6%). Nineteen patients (20%) permanently discontinued fedratinib due to a TEAE; diarrhea and thrombocytopenia (n = 2 each) were the only TEAEs leading to discontinuation in >1 patient. Fedratinib-related TEAEs led to permanent treatment discontinuation for 10 patients (10%). Two patients discontinued fedratinib due to treatment-related anemia or thrombocytopenia (n = 1 each). One case of grade 3 hepatic encephalopathy occurred in the JAKARTA2 study, and no confirmed case of Wernicke’s encephalopathy (WE) occurred.Encephalopathy The fedratinib development program was placed on clinical hold in November 2013 due to suspected cases of drug-related WE, a rare neurological disorder induced by a deficiency of thiamine (vitamin B1). Among the more than 600 patients treated with multiple fedratinib doses in clinical trials, 8 (1.3%) potential cases of WE were reported and 1 case (0.16%) was fatal  Most events resolved with some residual neurological symptoms. Retrospective analysis of potential WE events suggested that affected patients experienced predisposing conditions known to lead to WE in any population (e.g., underlying\\n\", additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}), HumanMessage(content='Fedratinib uses in myelofibrosis', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={})])"

      "Yes, **fedratinib** is an approved treatment for **myelofibrosis (MF)**, a rare and progressive bone marrow disorder in which the bone marrow becomes scarred and unable to produce healthy blood cells.\n",
      "\n",
      "### What is Fedratinib?\n",
      "\n",
      "Fedratinib is a **JAK2 inhibitor** — a class of drugs that block the activity of the Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) protein, which is often overactive in myelofibrosis, especially in patients with the JAK2 mutation.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Indications in Myelofibrosis\n",
      "\n",
      "Fedratinib is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and other regulatory bodies for the treatment of:\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Adult patients with intermediate- or high-risk myelofibrosis** who are **not eligible for or have failed allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation**.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is particularly indicated for patients with **JAK2-mutated myelofibrosis**, which is the most common genetic subtype.\n",
      "\n",
      "### How Does Fedratinib Work?\n",
      "\n",
      "- It inhibits JAK2 signaling, which helps reduce the abnormal proliferation of blood cells and the scarring (fibrosis) in the bone marrow.\n",
      "- This can lead to:\n",
      "  - Improved symptoms (e.g., fatigue, itching, splenomegaly)\n",
      "  - Reduced spleen size\n",
      "  - Improved quality of life\n",
      "  - Potential delay in disease progression\n",
      "\n",
      "### Key Benefits and Outcomes\n",
      "\n",
      "Clinical trials (such as the **FEDERATE** trial) have shown that fedratinib:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Significantly reduces spleen volume (a key symptom of MF)\n",
      "- Improves patient-reported symptoms\n",
      "- Is generally well-tolerated, with a manageable side effect profile\n",
      "\n",
      "### Common Side Effects\n",
      "\n",
      "While generally safe, fedratinib may cause:\n",
      "\n",

      "- Hypertension (high blood pressure)\n",
      "- Thrombocytopenia (low platelets)\n",
      "- Fatigue\n",
      "- Nausea\n",
      "- Diarrhea\n",
      "\n",
      "Regular monitoring of blood counts and liver function is required.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Important Considerations\n",
      "\n",
      "- Fedratinib is **not a cure** for myelofibrosis.\n",
      "- It is typically used as a **symptomatic and disease-modifying therapy**.\n",
      "- It may be used in combination with other treatments or as monotherapy depending on the patient’s condition.\n",
      "- It is not effective in all patients — response varies, and some may not benefit.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Who Should Consider Fedratinib?\n",
      "\n",
      "- Patients with **intermediate- or high-risk myelofibrosis**\n",
      "- Patients with **JAK2 mutations**\n",
      "- Patients who have **symptomatic disease** (e.g., large spleen, fatigue)\n",

      "### Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "Fedratinib is a **valid and effective treatment option** for patients with myelofibrosis, especially those with JAK2 mutations and intermediate-to-high risk disease. It helps manage symptoms, reduce spleen size, and improve quality of life.\n",

      "Fedratinib is an oral, selective JAK2 protein inhibitor approved for the treatment of adult patients with intermediate-2 or high-risk myelofibrosis (MF), a life-threatening myeloproliferative neoplasm characterized by bone marrow fibrosis, cytopenias, splenomegaly, constitutional symptoms, and shortened survival.\n",
      "\n",
      "Key aspects of fedratinib use in myelofibrosis include:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Efficacy in Reducing Spleen Size and Symptoms**:\n",
      "   - Fedratinib induces a significant reduction in spleen volume, with a spleen volume response rate (SVRR)—defined as a ≥35% reduction in spleen volume from baseline—of 37% in the pivotal JAKARTA trial at end of cycle 6 (EOC6), compared to 1% in the placebo arm.\n",
      "   - Symptom burden improves significantly, with a ≥50% reduction in total symptom score (TSS) on the modified Myelofibrosis Symptom Assessment Form (MFSAF) observed in a subset of patients.\n",
      "   - Spleen response is durable, with a median duration of 18.2 months in the JAKARTA trial.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Improvement in Hematological Parameters**:\n",
      "   - Fedratinib reduces white blood cell (WBC) counts and hematocrit, leading to normalization of leukocytosis and thrombocytosis in a majority of patients.\n",
      "   - In patients with baseline leukocytosis (>11 × 10⁹/L), 57% achieved normal WBC counts after 6 months of treatment.\n",
      "   - In patients with thrombocytosis (>450 × 10⁹/L), 90% attained normal platelet counts.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Anti-Fibrotic Effects**:\n",
      "   - In clinical and preclinical studies, fedratinib reduces bone marrow fibrosis. In a phase I extension study, 15/18 evaluable patients had stabilized or improved bone marrow fibrosis by cycle 6, and 4/9 patients showed complete resolution by cycle 30.\n",
      "   - In animal models, fedratinib attenuates collagen accumulation and hepatic stellate cell activation, suggesting anti-fibrotic activity beyond the bone marrow.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Mechanism of Action**:\n",
      "   - Fedratinib inhibits the JAK2/STAT signaling pathway, which is constitutively activated in MF and drives clonal expansion and disease progression.\n",
      "   - It also exhibits off-target inhibitory activity against BRD4 protein (a BET family bromodomain protein), leading to synergistic suppression of NF-κB hyperactivation and CCL1 protein production, which contributes to inflammation and fibrosis.\n",
      "   - This dual inhibition may enhance anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic effects, such as upregulation of adiponectin and downregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., TNF-α, CCL5).\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Activity Regardless of JAK2 Mutation Status**:\n",
      "   - Fedratinib is effective in patients with or without JAK2V617F mutations, making it a valuable option for patients who may not have the mutation or who have lost response to other therapies.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Clinical Use and Dosing**:\n",
      "   - The recommended starting dose is 400 mg once daily, with a maximum tolerated dose of 680 mg/day.\n",
      "   - The drug is rapidly absorbed, with peak plasma concentrations reached at 2–3 hours post-dose and an effective half-life of 41 hours.\n",
      "   - Steady-state concentrations are achieved by day 15 of treatment.\n",
      "   - Dose modifications are often needed due to hematologic toxicities, especially in patients with low baseline platelet counts or anemia.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Safety and Adverse Events**:\n",
      "   - The most common adverse events are grades 1–2 gastrointestinal events (nausea, diarrhea, vomiting), which are most frequent in early treatment and decrease over time.\n",
      "   - Grades 3–4 hematologic toxicities (anemia, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia) occur in a subset of patients, with anemia being the most common (34% of patients in JAKARTA2), and thrombocytopenia in 12%.\n",
      "   - Permanent discontinuation due to hematologic events is rare (~3%).\n",
      "   - A rare but serious risk is Wernicke’s encephalopathy (WE), a neurological disorder due to thiamine deficiency. Suspected cases were reported in ~1.3% of patients in clinical trials (8 out of >600), with one fatal case. Thiamine levels should be monitored before and during treatment, especially in patients with malnutrition or gastrointestinal events.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. **Use in Patients Who Have Discontinued Ruxolitinib**:\n",
      "   - Fedratinib is effective in patients who have discontinued ruxolitinib due to cytopenias, suboptimal response, or intolerance, offering a second-line therapy option.\n",
      "   - In the JAKARTA2 study, 33% of patients started with platelet counts <100 × 10⁹/L, and 46% of these experienced grades 3–4 anemia, highlighting the need for careful monitoring and supportive care.\n",
      "\n",
      "9. **Ongoing Research and Future Directions**:\n",
      "   - Phase III trials (FREEDOM and FREEDOM2) are evaluating fedratinib’s long-term safety, efficacy, and impact on overall survival in patients with intermediate-2 or high-risk MF who have previously received ruxolitinib.\n",
      "   - Combination therapies (e.g., with decitabine or BET inhibitors) are under investigation to improve outcomes and overcome resistance.\n",
      "   - The role of fedratinib in bridging to hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) and in post-MPN acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is being explored.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, fedratinib is a well-tolerated, effective, and versatile treatment for patients with intermediate-2 or high-risk myelofibrosis, offering significant improvements in spleen size, symptoms, and bone marrow fibrosis, with activity across JAK2 mutation statuses and in patients who have failed prior therapy. Its use is supported by robust clinical trial data and ongoing research into long-term outcomes and combination strategies.\n"

Its functions annotating how cells react to oxygen were made conspicuous by the 2019 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. These pathways can interact with those resulting from GSVAB), such as the NOD2 PROTEIN signaling pathway and TP53 PROTEIN signaling pathway. We applied single-gene GSEA with the guilt by association method to annotate the functions of SLC2A12. Single-gene GSEA was usually performed after samples were divided into two groups, the highly expressed group and the lowly expressed group, according to the median expression level of the selected gene. In this GSEA, a decreasingly ranked gene list based on correlation values with SLC2A12 PROTEIN was used. Guilt by association approach in GSEA can deduce the enriched potential KEGG pathways SLC2A12 PROTEIN involved in. We deduced that SLC2A12 PROTEIN activated multiple organic substance metabolism pathways and suppressed immune response pathways including the JAK/STAT signaling pathway, CCL15 PROTEIN signaling pathway, PPIB PROTEIN and PTCRA PROTEIN signaling pathway. The roles of SLC2A12 PROTEIN in metabolism and immune response pathways merit further research. Misregulated ferroptosis can be implicated in multiple immune events23. Recently, Rui Kong reported that activation of the JAK/STAT pathway can induce ferroptosis in hepatocellular carcinoma cells24. In addition, the JAK/STAT pathway can participate in various biological processes in VSMCs25 and crosstalk with HIF1A PROTEIN pathway26,27. To date, no evidence has interpreted the correlation between SLC2A12 PROTEIN and the JAK/STAT signaling pathway. The functions of SLC2A12 PROTEIN in immune activity should be explored in the future.

The IL-6-mediated JAK/STAT signaling pathway promotes cancer progression by inhibiting autophagy.264,265 Recent studies have shown that resveratrol inhibits the IL-6–mediated JAK/STAT signaling pathway, causing autophagy and prevents ovarian cancer cell migration, according to recent studies. In primary effusion lymphoma, quercetin inhibits STAT-III to induce autophagy. Docetaxel-mediated autophagy inhibited STAT-III to reduce castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) cell survival and metastasis.266–269 Another study on Head and neck squamous cell carcinomas revealed that Inhibition of either IL6R PROTEIN or EPHB2 PROTEIN effectively reverses EMT and re-sensitizes cells to ionizing radiation.

In contrast, whereas human mast cell function in Job’s syndrome patients was affected somewhat by the reduced STAT3 PROTEIN signaling , the STAT3-dependent transcriptional activity within endothelial cells that regulates critical components involved in the architecture and functional dynamics of endothelial junctions, i.e., microRNA17-92, PTEN PROTEIN, SRC PROTEIN, E2F, and β-catenin, is a more important contributor to reduced endothelial cell permeability and anaphylaxis protection in these patients .B. Janus Kinase/Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 3 and Metabolism 1.

Leptin/LepRb/JAK2/STAT3 signaling plays major roles in energy homeostasis and neuroendocrine function, through upregulation of POMC DNA (POMC CELL_LINE), the precursor protein for melanocyte-stimulating hormones; corticotrophin; and β-endorphin, each of which increases appetite (Millington, 2007), and the down-regulation of'),\n",

We found that the full-length protein was part of key cellular events with P-values suggesting high significance (ranging from 1.18E-09 to 5.21E-16) and that each domain was particularly involved in a select set of cellular events, some of which were shared and some were unique. An overall look at the canonical pathways suggested that the endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) was one of the key cellular activities for spastin protein, where the full-length protein (P = 5.21E-16), HD domain (P = 5.41E-07), MIT domain (P = 9.51E-8) and the AAA domain (P = 6.29E-08) all participated with significance that cannot be explained by luck. The ESCRT pathway plays a major role in the formation of endosomal compartments and vesicular trafficking . It consists of several complexes, including ESCRT-0, -I, -II, -III, and the VPS4A PROTEIN, each playing a distinct role in the formation of intraluminal vesicles and multi-vesicular bodies. The connection between the spastin protein and ESCRT proteins has been previously reported . ESCRT proteins not only help with this localization, but they also assist in polarized membrane trafficking, coupled with the enzymatic activity of the AAA region . Additionally, dysfunction of the ESCRT pathway has been canonically reported to have neurodegenerative effects, especially through stress-mediated pathways . Therefore, the relationship between ESCRT and the spastin protein interactome is robust and offers novel mechanistic insight into a potential avenue of pathogenesis. Several of the other identified canonical pathways in the spastin protein interactome demonstrated both a functional and mechanistic relationship with the ESCRT pathway. For example, autophagy, which is significantly related to the spastin protein interactome through the late endosomal microautophagy and macroautophagy pathways, is mediated through components of ESCRT-I and ESCRT-III .

This study found through combined analysis that ECHDC1 DNA was differentially expressed in intramuscular fat tissues of beef with varying grades, and previous studies found that interference with this gene inhibited the number of intracellular lipid droplets  However, existing studies have not clearly explored the regulatory role of the ECHDC1 DNA in the adipogenesis of bovine intramuscular adipocytes, and the potential interaction between ECHDC1 DNA and other lipid metabolism-related genes remains to be further clarified. Based on the above research gaps, this study hypothesizes that the ECHDC1 DNA may play a key regulatory role in bovine intramuscular fat deposition and intends to initially investigate its molecular regulatory mechanisms. ECHDC1 DNA is a cytoplasmic enzyme that catalyzes the decarboxylation of ethyl or methyl malonyl-CoA  thereby playing a role in fatty acid synthesis and restricting the synthesis of abnormal fatty acids, such as ethyl or methyl-branched fatty acids  This study analyzed the spatiotemporal specificity of ECHDC1 DNA and found that it may be involved in the early stages of preadipocyte differentiation.

       "'The GHR PROTEIN signaling pathway plays important roles in growth, metabolism, cell cycle control, immunity, homeostatic processes, and chemoresistance via both the JAK/STAT and the SRC PROTEIN pathways. Dysregulation of GHR PROTEIN signaling is associated with various diseases and chronic conditions such as acromegaly, cancer, aging, metabolic disease, fibroses, inflammation and autoimmunity. Numerous studies entailing the GHR PROTEIN signaling pathway have been conducted for various cancers. Diverse factors mediate the up- or down-regulation of GHR PROTEIN signaling through post-translational modifications. Of the numerous modifications, ubiquitination and deubiquitination are prominent events. Ubiquitination by PRKN PROTEIN attaches UBD PROTEIN to target proteins and induces proteasomal degradation or starts the sequence of events that leads to endocytosis and lysosomal degradation. In this review, we discuss the role of first line effectors that act directly on the GHR PROTEIN at the cell surface including ADAM17 PROTEIN, JAK2 PROTEIN, SRC family member Lyn, Ubc13/CHIP, proteasome, βTrCP, CK2, STAT5B PROTEIN, and SOCS2 PROTEIN. Activity of all, except JAK2 PROTEIN, LYN PROTEIN and STAT5B PROTEIN, counteract GHR PROTEIN signaling. Loss of their function increases the GH-induced signaling in favor of aging and certain chronic diseases, exemplified by increased lung cancer risk in case of a mutation in the SOCS2-GHR interaction site. Insight in their roles in GHR PROTEIN signaling can be applied for cancer and other therapeutic strategies. : aging, cancer, ubiquitin, endocytosis, POU1F1 PROTEIN axis, GH sensitivityIntroduction In 1989 with a background of posttranslational modifications and intracellular transport of IL6R PROTEIN our lab decided to focus on studying the role of ubiquitination in membrane trafficking. Knowledge on the role of ubiquitination as a major regulator of cell functions had just started to emerge . To address the question of whether\\n\\nby GH was shown to activate MAPKs, also referred to as MAPK1 PROTEIN (MAPK3 PROTEIN and MAPK1 PROTEIN), through the PLCD1 PROTEIN Cγ-Ras pathway, signaling that might promote oncogenesis . Genes exclusively regulated by LYN PROTEIN include genes involved in mRNA transcription and metabolism, including the GHR PROTEIN itself: the basal GHR PROTEIN expression level via LYN PROTEIN is 4.8-fold higher, comparing GHR Box1-/- vs. GHR-/- . GHR signaling via this pathway induces also HLA-G, a powerful immunosuppressive protein for NK cells and macrophages. GH-enhanced immunosuppression in tumors might evade immune attack. On the other hand, it might be used to stop excessive inflammation after partial hepatectomy allowing liver regeneration and survival, Figs. 4 and 7 . For 3T3-F442A preadipocytes and H4IIE hepatoma cells it has been shown that relative levels of JAK2 PROTEIN and SRC family kinase in any particular cell might determine which MAP2K1 PROTEIN is the major signaling element, with JAK2 PROTEIN predominating in most cases . Barclay and co-workers showed that targeted mutation in the STUB1 PROTEIN of GHR PROTEIN in mice, although abrogating JAK2 PROTEIN activation, did not decrease the hepatic activation of MAPK1 PROTEIN via LYN PROTEIN . The importance of this pathway came from studies with exon 3-deleted GHR, which results in the deletion of 22 amino acids in the LYVE1 PROTEIN of the GHR. Males with this genotype exhibit reduced basal but enhanced EPHB2 PROTEIN signaling after GH stimulation. Exon 3-deleted GHR individuals showed lower serum IGF-1 levels, and were found to be of higher stature with extended lifespan (10 years) .Signaling Pathways of GH1 PROTEIN The main pathways activated by GH are: the STAT1 PROTEIN pathway, the MAPKAPK2 PROTEIN (MAPK1 PROTEIN) pathway, and the PIK3CD PROTEIN (PIK3CA PROTEIN) pathway.

The extent by which each pathway is activated depends on the cell types, related to differences in relative expression levels of the components\\n\\npathway. In the scheme also molecules involved in signal termination (PTS PROTEIN, CISH PROTEIN and PIAS1 PROTEIN) are indicated. Inthe physiology and pathophysiology are further detailed.The phosphorylation of specific tyrosine residues, brought about by JAK2 PROTEIN and LYN PROTEIN, has extensively been studied as intermediaries for recruiting downstream signaling effectors . Herewith in agreement, we confirmed that tyrosine residues 487, 534, and 627, but not residue 566, are most important for GHR PROTEIN and STAT5B PROTEIN phosphorylation. In addition, we showed that the GHR(Y627F) mutation constitutively (independent of GH binding) activates JAK2 and downstream effectors .JAK2 Activation JAK2 PROTEIN is composed of four major domains: a N-terminal FERM (4.1 protein, EZR PROTEIN, RDXP1 PROTEIN, and moesin) domain, followed by a SH2 (Src homology 2) domain, pseudokinase and kinase domains. The binding to the STUB1 PROTEIN of GHR PROTEIN occurs through the FRMD4A PROTEIN . Normally JAK2 PROTEIN is held in an inactive conformation, where the MAP2K1 PROTEIN and pseudokinase domain interact with each other . The activation of JAK2 PROTEIN requires that two catalytic domains are brought in close proximity. This was concluded after realizing that often in human leukemia there is oligomerization of JAK2 molecules which renders them constitutively active; this aggregation is due to the occurrence of a genetic fusion between the JAK2 catalytic domain and the oncogenic transcription factor TEL . Analysis of other mutation also contributed to the understanding of JAK2 PROTEIN physiology. The mutation V617A, which turns JAK2 PROTEIN into a constitutively active state, is found in patients with myeloproliferative disorders . This mutation probably disrupts the inhibitory interaction between the pseudokinase and kinase domain . Following mutational analysis, the SH2-pseudokinase domain linker turned out to be important for JAK2 PROTEIN activation . JAK2 PROTEIN activation'"
